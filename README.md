Simple Named Pipe Example

This repository contains a simple example of how to use named pipes for interprocess communication in a Unix-like environment. The example provides an implementation of two basic functions: a named pipe-based "get" function that reads data from a pipe, and a named pipe-based "set" function that writes data to a pipe.

The repository is designed to be easy to use and understand, and includes detailed documentation and code comments to help users get started quickly. The codebase is written in C, and includes example programs that demonstrate how to use the named pipe functions in a variety of scenarios.

Whether you are new to named pipes or an experienced developer looking for a simple, reliable solution for interprocess communication, this repository provides a great starting point for your next project.

Keywords: named pipes, interprocess communication, Unix, C programming, examples, documentation.
